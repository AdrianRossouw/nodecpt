    title: Intro to Underscore.js
    description: I'll run through some of the features of the most depended on package in npm. Underscore.js is quickly becoming a requirement for both server-side and client side developers, and its collection of small utility functions will help you work more efficiently with data structures. Underscore.js also forms the basis or inspiration for several other popular libraries, such as Backbone and Spine.

The August NodeCPT meetup will be held on the __23rd of August 2012__ at [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/) in Claremont.

After a break from our presentation schedule, we will be returning with the first part in a series of presentations aimed at  introducing some of the more popular node.js libraries.

{% include presentations.html %}

The presentation itself will be fairly short this time, so if anyone wants to present on their pet library there will definitely be time. This presentation will be followed by an introduction to Backbone in September and then in October we will be covering Socket.io.

 
There will be beer provided at the venue, and if you want to come earlier to hang out with us, the door will be open. We will try to get the presentation started by 18:30, and will try to get everything 'official' wrapped up by 20:30 at the very latest so people can grab something to eat.

We hope to see you there!
