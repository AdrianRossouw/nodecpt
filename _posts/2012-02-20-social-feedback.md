We had our first ever meetup this thursday past, and I believe I speak for those involved when I say it was a great success. It was very nice meeting up with a group of like-minded developers and being able to discuss technology in a way that we might not be able to in our day-to-day lives/jobs.

We managed to attract more than a dozen people for this meetup, which is actually pretty amazing because of the short notice, lack of any formal structure and fledgeling nature of our group.

### New Venue

We were also very fortunate to have organized a meeting that conflicted with the [happy hour](http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=happy_hour) organized by the guys from [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php), because in doing so we stumbled across a great bunch of collaborators and more importantly the perfect venue for future meetings.

> [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php) is a new developer community center based in Claremont, Cape Town. Its an attempt at building a small startup hub as well as an open space for developers/hackers to come and work based on the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, CA.

I believe that this space is going to be a very important resource for the node- and other communities, and we should do what we can to support them. They are also desperately looking for spare furniture to equip the shared working space they are trying to provide, so please ping them out if you have anything to contribute to the cause.

### Minutes

We discussed how frequently to meet and what the structure of the meetups should be, and the consensus was:

* We should try to meet once a month.
* The next meetup should be in 2 weeks time.
* Focus on a single presentation per meeting.
* Audio recordings of the presentations is important.
* Slides should be uploaded where possible.
* Meetings should start at 6:30 to account for travel.
* Meetings should end by 8:00 at the latest to allow for dinner time.
* Social time before and after, so not a hard and fast rule.


### Next Meeting

We will be officially announcing the next meetup and the topic very soon, with announcements going out via twitter and an update to this site. You can follow changes to this site by using the 'watch' button to subscribe to it via your github account. We will also be introducing RSS and other functionality to make sure people stay informed.

Thanks to everyone who took part in the meetup, and our gracious hosts. We will be in touch soon.
