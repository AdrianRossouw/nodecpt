The July NodeCPT social will be held on the __19th of July 2012__ at [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/) in Claremont. This is a great opportunity to learn more about node.js, hear how people are using it, and get to know other local developers using and considering node.js.

We are taking a break this month from the usual technical content to organize a meet-and-greet instead. Our last few meetings have been heavily presentation oriented, which hasn't allowed us much opportunity to get to know each other.

The official times are between 18:30 and 20:00, but if you want to come earlier to hang out with us, the door will be open. There will be beer provided at the venue, so all you need to bring is yourself, a healthy sense of curiosity and perhaps some node.js war stories to regale us with.

We hope to see you there!
