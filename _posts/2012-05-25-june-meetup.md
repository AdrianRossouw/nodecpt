The June NodeCPT meetup will be held on the __7th of June 2012__ at [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=directions) in Claremont. This is a great opportunity to learn more about node.js, hear how people are using it, and get to know other local developers using and considering node.js.

Due to the unconventional nature of the presentation, we might run late to about 20:30 on thursday night. This is dependent on how many questions we get and how quickly we can work through the material. The application will be posted on github afterwards.

There will be beer provided at the venue, and if you want to come earlier to hang out with us, the door will be open. We will try to get the presentation started by 18:30, and will try to get everything 'official' wrapped up by 20:30 at the very latest so people can grab something to eat.

We hope to see you there!
