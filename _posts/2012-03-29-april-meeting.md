Our April meetup is going to be happening on the __5th of April 2012__ at [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=directions) in Claremont.

We will be having a series of show-and-tell session about projects that have been built with Node.js and especially those that play to it's strengths.

{% include presentations.html %}

There will be beer provided at the venue, and if you want to come earlier to hang out with us, the door will be open. We will try to get the presentation started by 18:30, and will try to get everything 'official' wrapped up by 20:00 at the very latest so people can grab something to eat. Remember, thursday isn't a school night, as the friday is a public holiday.

We hope to see you there!
