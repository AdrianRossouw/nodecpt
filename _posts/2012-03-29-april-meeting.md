Our April meetup is going to be happening on the __5th of April 2012__ at [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=directions) in Claremont.

We will be having a series of show-and-tell session about projects that have been built with Node.js and especially those that play to it's strengths.

If you want to show off what you have been building in Node, or you know of something cool that you would like to share with us, please let us know, as we are still short of presenters.

Each presentation should be about 5-10 minutes, and will be followed by a quick Q&A. We would like to announce the topics early next week, so please get in touch before then.

There will be beer provided at the venue, and if you want to come earlier to hang out with us, the door will be open. We will try to get the presentation started by 18:30, and will try to get everything 'official' wrapped up by 20:00 at the very latest so people can grab something to eat. Remember, thursday isn't a school night, as the friday is a public holiday.

We hope to see you there!
