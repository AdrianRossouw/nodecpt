We hit a bit of a wobble last week when we realized that the change of date might not have reached everybody in time. If you drove to the venue only to find a note on the door, we are truly sorry to have inconvenienced you.

To avoid something like this happening in the future, we have made improvements to the website and put some additional infrastructure in place.

1. We now have a [NodeCPT Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/nodecpt), which acts as a mailing list.
1. The sidebar now contains the the links to all the relevant services you can use to connect with us.
1. Added a link to the RSS feed of this site.
1. The sidebar now has a block showing the date of the next event, as well as a link to the relevant page.
1. Event pages now have a link to the relevant [Lanyard](http://www.lanyard.com) event, and we will be adding a new event for each meeting. This way you can see who will be attending.
1. Twitter block is no longer relegated to the footer.

We look forward to seeing everybody on thursday, and if you have any other suggestions, please drop us a line on twitter or any of the other channels.
