[Le Roux Bodenstein](http://twitter.com/__leroux) gave a not-so-quick introduction to node. The slides as well as the code for the [socket.io](http://socket.io/)-powered server for advancing the slides are up on [github](http://github.com/lerouxb/nodeintro).

The turnout was quite impressive and the people that attended came from varying backgrounds: Some PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET and even Java programmers.

### Next Meeting

We're planning on doing a series of short showcase-style presentations where we show off projects that use node in the wild. If you want to present an app, library, framework or whatever that was written using node.js, please ping us on twitter. Ideas would include projects that make good use of some of node or JavaScript's strengths or actually just anything that uses node. So far [Adrian](http://twitter.com/AdrianRossouw) and [Le Roux](http://twitter.com/__leroux) will be presenting.

The next meeting will be on the 5th of April. We'll likely post again closer to the time with updated information.
