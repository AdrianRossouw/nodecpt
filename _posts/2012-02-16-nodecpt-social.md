We have decided to organize a meet and greet this week to get the wheels rolling on this user group.

We do plan on announcing a more formal meetup soon, but it would be nice to get to know each other a bit beforehand. 

If you are interested in taking part in this node.js user group, please join us on thursday for a couple of beers and some interesting conversation.

We are hoping to get a handle on the size of the community and its general interests. This information will help us plan the format and content of future meetups.
