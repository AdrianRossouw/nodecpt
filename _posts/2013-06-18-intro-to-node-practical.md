Following our first meetup about the [Intro to NodeJS](http://johanndutoit.net/presentations/2013/05/node-meetup-intro-29-may-2013/index.html) is happening on __19 June 2013__ at [Acceleration, 2nd Floor, Longkloof Studios, Darters Road, Gardens](https://maps.google.co.za/maps?q=acceleration+darters+road+cape+town&ie=UTF-8&ei=z92xUevyK66f7AaS0IDwBg&ved=0CAsQ_AUoAg).

{% include presentations.html %}

[Simon Bishop](https://github.com/southbite) is presenting a Practical Introduction to NodeJS. This session will focus on building a actual NodeJS Clustered System. That will show the power of NodeJS. Think multiple Nodes talking to each other with a very cool visual presentation of the connected Nodes. Should be great !

[Acceleration](http://www.acceleration.biz/) has provided the venue.

[KeyConnections](http://www.keyconnections.co.za/) has graciously sponsored free Pizza for the event.

We will try our best to find a sponsor for some Beer and Drinks.

Doors will open from 18:00 and we will try to get started at the latest by 19:00, If you're early pop by and have a drink with us. We plan to wrap up by 21:00 at the latest.

These meetings are a great way to meet other developers who have similar interests, and offer amazing opportunities to learn from each other. Also, they are a great excuse to get out of the house and socialize.

We hope to see you there!
