We have decided to organize a meet and greet this week to get the wheels rolling on this user group.

We do plan on announcing a more formal meetup soon, but it would be nice to get to know each other a bit beforehand.

If you are interested in taking part in this node.js user group, please join us on Thursday for a couple of beers and some interesting conversation.

We are hoping to get a handle on the size of the community and its general interests. This information will help us plan the format and content of future meetups.

**UPDATE:** We are moving the location so that we can join up with the codebridge Happy Hour which was already planned to take place at exactly the same time. Arrive, meet people, have some beers (we'll bring a few) and we'll take it from there. More details on the [codebridge wiki](http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=happy_hour).
