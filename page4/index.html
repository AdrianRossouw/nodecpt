    <p>Our first official meetup is going to be happening on the <strong>1st of March 2012</strong> at <a href='http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=directions'>CodeBridge</a> in Claremont.</p>

<p>Our goal this time is going to give everybody a crash course about exactly what node.js is, how it works and when you should use it. If you have heard about it, but aren&#8217;t sure if it is for you, then you should come to this meeting. Experts are also welcome.</p>

<p>There will be beer provided at the venue, and if you want to come earlier to hang out with us, the door will be open. We will try to get the presentation started by 18:30, and will try to get everything &#8216;official&#8217; wrapped up by 20:00 at the very latest so people can grab something to eat.</p>

<p>These meetings are a great way to meet other developers who have similar interests, and offer amazing opportunities to learn from each other. Also, they are a great excuse to get out of the house and socialize.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there!</p>

    <p>We had our first ever meetup this thursday past, and I believe I speak for those involved when I say it was a great success. It was very nice meeting up with a group of like-minded developers and being able to discuss technology in a way that we might not be able to in our day-to-day lives/jobs.</p>

<p>We managed to attract more than a dozen people for this meetup, which is actually pretty amazing because of the short notice, lack of any formal structure and fledgeling nature of our group.</p>

<h3 id='new_venue'>New Venue</h3>

<p>We were also very fortunate to have organized a meeting that conflicted with the <a href='http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=happy_hour'>happy hour</a> organized by the guys from <a href='http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php'>CodeBridge</a>, because in doing so we stumbled across a great bunch of collaborators and more importantly the perfect venue for future meetings.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I believe that this space is going to be a very important resource for the node- and other communities, and we should do what we can to support them. They are also desperately looking for spare furniture to equip the shared working space they are trying to provide, so please ping them out if you have anything to contribute to the cause.</p>

<h3 id='minutes'>Minutes</h3>

<p>We discussed how frequently to meet and what the structure of the meetups should be, and the consensus was:</p>

<ul>
<li>We should try to meet once a month.</li>

<li>The next meetup should be in 2 weeks time.</li>

<li>Focus on a single presentation per meeting.</li>

<li>Audio recordings of the presentations is important.</li>

<li>Slides should be uploaded where possible.</li>

<li>Meetings should start at 6:30 to account for travel.</li>

<li>Meetings should end by 8:00 at the latest to allow for dinner time.</li>

<li>Social time before and after, so not a hard and fast rule.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='next_meeting'>Next Meeting</h3>

<p>We will be officially announcing the next meetup and the topic very soon, with announcements going out via twitter and an update to this site. You can follow changes to this site by using the &#8216;watch&#8217; button to subscribe to it via your github account. We will also be introducing RSS and other functionality to make sure people stay informed.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who took part in the meetup, and our gracious hosts. We will be in touch soon.</p>

    <p>We have decided to organize a meet and greet this week to get the wheels rolling on this user group.</p>

<p>We do plan on announcing a more formal meetup soon, but it would be nice to get to know each other a bit beforehand.</p>

<p>If you are interested in taking part in this node.js user group, please join us on Thursday for a couple of beers and some interesting conversation.</p>

<p>We are hoping to get a handle on the size of the community and its general interests. This information will help us plan the format and content of future meetups.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We are moving the location so that we can join up with the codebridge Happy Hour which was already planned to take place at exactly the same time. Arrive, meet people, have some beers (we&#8217;ll bring a few) and we&#8217;ll take it from there. More details on the <a href='http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=happy_hour'>codebridge wiki</a>.</p>
