Hi. We're trying to get a feel for how many people are coming to the [March meetup](http://nodecpt.github.com/2012/02/march-meetup/) on thursday, so we set up an event on [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/nodecpt-march/attendees/) to try and track this sort of thing.

Please [add yourself as an attendee](http://lanyrd.com/2012/nodecpt-march/attendees/) if you're coming so that we know how much beer to buy, how many chairs we have to borrow and generally how stressed the [first-time speaker](http://twitter.com/__leroux) has to be. Oh and if someone knows of a projector we could borrow, [please get in contact with us](http://twitter.com/NodeCPT). Otherwise we'll just wing it with a relatively large monitor.
