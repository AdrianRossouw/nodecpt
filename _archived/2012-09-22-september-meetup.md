The September NodeCPT meetup will be held on the __27th of September 2012__ at [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/) in Claremont.

We will be continuing our series of presentations on popular javascript libraries with a look at [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org).

There will be beer provided at the venue, and if you want to come earlier to hang out with us, the door will be open. We will try to get the presentation started by 19:00, and will try to get everything 'official' wrapped up by 20:30 at the very latest so people can grab something to eat.

We hope to see you there!
