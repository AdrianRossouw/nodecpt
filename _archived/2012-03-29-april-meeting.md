__Imporant Notice:__ Due to some technical difficulties, and the preponderance of long weekends in the silly season, we have decided to reschedule our April meetup to be held on the __3rd of May 2012__ at [CodeBridge](http://www.codebridge.co.za/doku.php?id=directions) in Claremont.

We will be having a series of show-and-tell session about projects that have been built with Node.js and especially those that play to it's strengths.

{% include presentations.html %}

There will be beer provided at the venue, and if you want to come earlier to hang out with us, the door will be open. We will try to get the presentation started by 18:30, and will try to get everything 'official' wrapped up by 20:00 at the very latest so people can grab something to eat.

We hope to see you there!
